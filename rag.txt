Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly used across healthcare, finance, education, logistics, and creative industries, yet their effectiveness depends heavily on how data is stored, retrieved, and contextualized during inference. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid architecture that combines large language models with external knowledge sources such as documents, databases, or APIs, allowing the model to ground its responses in factual information rather than relying solely on parametric memory.
A typical RAG pipeline involves document ingestion, text normalization, chunking into semantically meaningful segments, embedding generation using a vector model, storage in a vector database, similarity search at query time, and prompt assembly using the top-k retrieved chunks.

Chunk size and overlap are critical parameters: chunks that are too large may dilute semantic relevance, while chunks that are too small may lose context, leading to fragmented answers. For example, a chunk size of 512 tokens with 50–100 tokens of overlap is commonly used, but optimal values vary depending on document type, query complexity, and embedding model. Evaluation of a RAG system often includes metrics such as retrieval precision, recall, faithfulness, and latency, as well as qualitative human review. 

Common failure modes include embedding drift, stale documents, hallucinations caused by weak retrieval, and poor chunk boundary decisions. Advanced systems may incorporate metadata filtering, hybrid search combining dense and sparse retrieval, reranking models, and caching strategies. 
Security and privacy are also important, especially when handling proprietary or personal data, requiring access controls, encryption, and audit logging. As RAG systems evolve, they are increasingly used for chatbots, internal knowledge assistants, code intelligence, and research summarization, making robust document preprocessing and chunking strategies a foundational requirement for reliable performance.
